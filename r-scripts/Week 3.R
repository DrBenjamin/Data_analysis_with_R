## Histogram
NHANES %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..count.., fill = ..density..), bins = 20)

NHANES %>% t.test(x = .$Age, mu = 35, data = ., conf.int = TRUE)


## Non-parametric analog = Wilson signed rank test
NHANES %>% wilcox.test(x = .$Age, mu = 35, data = ., conf.int = TRUE)


## 2 sample t-test version for comparison
NHANES %>%
  drop_na(Weight) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Weight)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..count.., fill = ..density..)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Gender))
# Possibly normally distributed, although interesting "bumps" on the left hand side (children?)

NHANES %>%
  t.test(.$Weight ~ .$Gender, data = .)

NHANES %>%
  wilcox.test(.$Weight ~ .$Gender, data = ., conf.int = TRUE)


## A new test, possibly cheaper than existing options, to detect the presence 
## of Helicobacter pylori is being developed. In the sample of individuals 
## tested (drawn from the attenders of adyspepsia clinic in Glasgow), 
## diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopic biopsy. The data are in the file: 
## Helicobacter.csv. Test is coded as 0 for negative and 1 for positive. Biopsy 
## is coded as 0 if H. pylori is absent and 1 if H. pylori is present
## 1.Calculate appropriate summary measures for test performance and describe 
## the testâ€™s performance in this population.

#continuous
AnginaMI <- read_csv("AnginaMI.csv")
AnginaMI %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = CreatineKinase,x = Diagnosis))+
  geom_boxplot()

reportROC(gold = AnginaMI$DiagnosisCat, predictor = AnginaMI$CreatineKinase,plot = TRUE, positive = 'l')

# b) boxplot
AnginaMI %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = CreatineKinase, x = Diagnosis))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)


## 2.b) What would you estimate the PPV and NPV of the test to be if it was 
## applied in London, if the prevalence of H. pylori was about 60% there?
